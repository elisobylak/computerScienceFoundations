open Sesame

Description of steps: I opened up Putty and entered in ada to the domain field.
After getting into the ada server I used the command cd to follow the path through /var then cd into /www then cd into /programs then cd into /csf then cd /csf1415 then cd/ java14f
Once here, I used the ls command to list all the contents of this directory 
Then I had to look up the command to view a document which is cat
Finally I used the command vi to open the file and view the contents.
