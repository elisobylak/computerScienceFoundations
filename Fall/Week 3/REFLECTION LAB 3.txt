REFLECTION LAB 3:This week in programming, we seemed to have moved up from creating basic classes and instances to putting these elements together so that multiple instances can be flowing from the same main. The example that comes to mind is the iJava problems about the program the writes the song Old MacDonald. In this example we got to play around with idea that the animal verses were objects and the song’s chorus would serve as the main. Also, the scanner method we introduced the other day seems quite useful as it seems to take input from a source and internalize the meaning and what to do with it.
