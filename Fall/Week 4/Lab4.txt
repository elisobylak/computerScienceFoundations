//REFLECTION//

I have not started the iJava work in chapter 4 for this week so this lab was especially difficult for me. 
I am currently working on my final draft for my research project, and the journal submission deadline is this weekend, so thatÕs where all of my time has been going this week. I figured I would start working on the iJava after I got through as much of the lab I could.
I have since completed the first task in the lab for which the code is above, and I am now working on the iJava work for this week. 
In the future IÕll have to organize my time better so that I have some of the text work before coming to lab.
