Although they are rather complex, it seems like once you get to know all the various facets of programming graphics it could be fairly straight forwards to practically use. I tried adding a button to the nested panel that we got for this lab, and I was able to add a button with a proper label on it. But I got stuck attempting to make the button do something. For that it seems like I would need another class for the button and it’s methods.
